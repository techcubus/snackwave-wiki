# 🌀 Snackwave Universe Wiki

Welcome to the official Snackwave Universe repository. This surreal, synth-soaked dimension blends snack food sentience, corporate dystopia, cursed music gear, and philosophical red pandas. It is equal parts zine lore, vaporwave collapse, and government onboarding manual.

## 📜 Overview

The **Snackwave Universe** is a hyperreal alternate reality where **snacks, synths, red pandas, and bio-AIs** coexist within a decaying corporate infrastructure. Governed by half-functional bureaucracies, populated by deranged mascots and malfunctioning synth modules, it is both a warning and an invitation.
